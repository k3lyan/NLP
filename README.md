# NLP
This repository aims at saving my work in the construction of a modulable Natural Langage Processing Pipeline (from raw inputs to visualizations). It is shaped according to 4 main sub-directories. Each of this sub-directory represents a block of the NLP pipeline. The goal of it is to be able to navigate and test easily different configurations by varying the algorithms used in the pipeline.

## PREPROCESING 
* get the data    
* extract to raw text    
* tokenization    
* filtering    
* dataBase/ search web engine (Elasticsearch, neo4j,...)    
* labelisation 
* ...    
## MODELIZATION
* language models (QRNN, bi-LSTM, ...)      
* CountVectorizer, TFIDF,...     
* ...     
## EXPLORATION ##
* topic modeling      
* similarity    
* sentiment analysis    
* clustering    
* classification    
* ...    
## VISUALIZATION ##
* statistical dashboard     
* dimensionnality reduction    
* termite/heatmap   
* scattermat   
* d3.js   
* ...
