# ELASTICSEARCH
This module aims at evaluating the Elasticsearch efficiency inside my pipeline.
## Comparative study: 
Comparaison between my semi-supervised management skills classifier and indexing/querying through Elasticsearch.   
Is Elasticsearch able to return the expected document in the top 5 (out of 47 possibilities)?
## Risk Detection:
* Indexing e-mails exchanged during a project with customized mappings and analyzer 
* Querying these e-mails with risk sentences from the risk register of this project
